Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, debugger, etc) to debug and solve problems
think of a theme for your game. having a theme makes it more interesting and can give you better vision.
Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
Commit early, commit often. Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
Consult documentation resources (MDN etc.) at home to better understand what youâ€™ll be getting into.
Donâ€™t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if youâ€™re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you havenâ€™t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
