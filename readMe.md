Development Steps
- Use Semantic markup for HTML and CSS 
- Choose div instead of table 
- Given each divs ID and define winning method
- Use Grid for CSS instead of flex for easier implementation
- Set Variables 
- Define Function 
- Use DOM to select each class and IDs and return to DOM node
- Refactorizing and proper comments

Current version
- Render a game in the browser 
- Switch turns between more than one player (2 player playing on a single computer)
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Design logic for a draw game & visually display when there is a draw
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Future Updates
To add game modes
(add animation and make boxes randomly moves at slow pace for medium and fast pace for hard)
